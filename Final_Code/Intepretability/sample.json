  "question": "The word imperialism has it's origins in which ancient language?",
  "context": "Imperialism is a type of advocacy of empire. Its name originated from the Latin word 'imperium', which means to rule over large territories. Imperialism is 'a policy of extending a country's power and influence through colonization, use of military force, or other means'. Imperialism has greatly shaped the contemporary world. It has also allowed for the rapid spread of technologies and ideas. The term imperialism has been applied to Western (and Japanese) political and economic dominance especially in Asia and Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries. Its precise meaning continues to be debated by scholars. Some writers, such as Edward Said, use the term more broadly to describe any system of domination and subordination organised with an imperial center and a periphery.",
