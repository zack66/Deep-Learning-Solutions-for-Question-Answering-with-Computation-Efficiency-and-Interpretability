Thereafter, during the last 18 years of his life, he gave only some 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon. He supported himself by selling his compositions and teaching piano, for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries, including Robert Schumann. In 1835 he obtained French citizenship. After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzińska, from 1837 to 1847 he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer George Sand. A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca with Sand in 1838–39 was one of his most productive periods of composition. In his last years, he was financially supported by his admirer Jane Stirling, who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848. Through most of his life, Chopin suffered from poor health.

On 11 August, three weeks after completing his studies at the Warsaw Conservatory, he made his debut in Vienna.

The critic François-Joseph Fétis wrote in the Revue et gazette musicale: \"Here is a young man who ... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music, ... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else ...\" After this concert, Chopin realized that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy Rothschild banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite). By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite, and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz. He no longer depended financially upon his father, and in the winter of 1832 he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over Europe.

Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833, in which Chopin, Liszt and Hiller performed (on pianos) a concerto by J.S. Bach for three keyboards; and, on 3 March 1838, a concert in which Chopin, his pupil Adolphe Gutmann, Charles-Valentin Alkan, and Alkan\\'s teacher Joseph Zimmermann performed Alkan\\'s arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from Beethoven\\'s 7th symphony. Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt\\'s Hexameron; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on Bellini\\'s theme. Chopin\\'s music soon found success with publishers, and in 1833 he contracted with Maurice Schlesinger, who arranged for it to be published not only in France but, through his family connections, also in Germany and England.',\n","   'qas': [{'answers': [{'answer_start': 218,\n","       'text': 'his own Paris apartment for small groups of friends'}],\n","     'id': '56cbfa0e6d243a140015ee2d',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': \"What was Frédéric's favorite environment to perform in?\"},\n","    {'answers': [{'answer_start': 738, 'text': 'pianos'}],\n","     'id': '56cbfa0e6d243a140015ee2e',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': 'What instrument did Frédéric play in a performance on 23 March 1833?'},\n","    {'answers': [{'answer_start': 107, 'text': 'Salle Pleyel'}],\n","     'id': '56cf75794df3c31400b0d7d1',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': 'Chopin gave a yearly performance where?'},\n","    {'answers': [{'answer_start': 1080, 'text': 'Hexameron'}],\n","     'id': '56cf75794df3c31400b0d7d2',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': 'Chopin worked with Liszt on what piece?'},\n","    {'answers': [{'answer_start': 1234, 'text': 'Maurice Schlesinger'}],\n","     'id': '56cf75794df3c31400b0d7d3',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': 'In 1833 with whom with Chopin work to get his music published?'},\n","    {'answers': [{'answer_start': 850, 'text': 'Adolphe Gutmann'}],\n","     'id': '56cf75794df3c31400b0d7d4',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': \"What is the name of Chopin's pupil who performed with him?\"},\n","    {'answers': [{'answer_start': 232, 'text': 'apartment'}],\n","     'id': '56d31dcb59d6e41400146259',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': 'Where did Chopin prefer to play for people?'},\n","    {'answers': [{'answer_start': 707, 'text': 'Liszt and Hiller'}],\n","     'id': '56d31dcb59d6e4140014625b',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': 'On March 23, 1833, who headlined and performed with Chopin at a concert?'},\n","    {'answers': [{'answer_start': 1234, 'text': 'Maurice Schlesinger'}],\n","     'id': '56d31dcb59d6e4140014625c',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': 'Who did Chopin contract with for publishing his music?'}]},\n","  {'context': 'In the spring of 1834, Chopin attended the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in Aix-la-Chapelle with Hiller, and it was there that Chopin met Felix Mendelssohn. After the festival, the three visited Düsseldorf, where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn described as \"a very agreeable day\", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as Lessing, Bendemann, Hildebrandt and Sohn. In 1835 Chopin went to Carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzińskis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter Maria in Poland five years earlier, when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via Leipzig. The sixteen-year-old girl\\'s portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix\\'s, as among Chopin\\'s best likenesses. In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, Clara Wieck and Felix Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio St. Paul, and who considered him \"a perfect musician\". In July 1836 Chopin travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to be with the Wodziński family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzińska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his G minor Ballade. At the end of 1836 he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1. The anodyne thanks he received from Maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her.',\n","   'qas': [{'answers': [{'answer_start': 137, 'text': 'Felix Mendelssohn'}],\n","     'id': '56cbfbdd6d243a140015ee36',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': 'Who did Frédéric meet in the spring of 1834 at the Lower Rhenish Music Festival?'},\n","    {'answers': [{'answer_start': 326,\n","       'text': 'playing and discussing music'}],\n","     'id': '56cbfbdd6d243a140015ee37',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': 'What two activities did Frédéric do while visiting for a day in Düsseldorf with Mendelssohn and Hiller?'},\n","    {'answers': [{'answer_start': 377, 'text': 'Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow'}],\n","     'id': '56cbfbdd6d243a140015ee38',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': 'Who was the director of the Academy of Art that Frédéric met while in Düsseldorf?'},\n","    {'answers': [{'answer_start': 540, 'text': 'Carlsbad'}],\n","     'id': '56cbfbdd6d243a140015ee39',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': \"Where were Frédéric's parents located at when he saw them for the final time in 1835?\"},\n","    {'answers': [{'answer_start': 39,\n","       'text': 'the Lower Rhenish Music Festival'}],\n","     'id': '56cf7b8a4df3c31400b0d81f',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': 'Where did Chopin meet Felix Mendelssohn?'},\n","    {'answers': [{'answer_start': 96, 'text': 'Hiller'}],\n","     'id': '56cf7b8a4df3c31400b0d820',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': 'Who did Chopin attend the Lower Rhenish Music Festival with?'},\n","    {'answers': [{'answer_start': 540, 'text': 'Carlsbad'}],\n","     'id': '56cf7b8a4df3c31400b0d821',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': 'In 1835 where did Chopin and his parents visit?'},\n","    {'answers': [{'answer_start': 1268, 'text': 'July 1836'}],\n","     'id': '56cf7b8a4df3c31400b0d822',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': 'When did Chopin propose marriage to Maria Wodziński?'},\n","    {'answers': [{'answer_start': 1405, 'text': 'Countess Wodzińska'}],\n","     'id': '56cf7b8a4df3c31400b0d823',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': \"Who was Maria's mother?\"},\n","    {'answers': [{'answer_start': 137, 'text': 'Felix Mendelssohn'}],\n","     'id': '56d31f8a59d6e41400146262',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': 'Who did Chopin meet at a music festival early in 1834?'},\n","    {'answers': [{'answer_start': 194, 'text': 'Düsseldorf'}],\n","     'id': '56d31f8a59d6e41400146263',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': 'Where did Chopin and Hiller go with the person Chopin met in the spring of 1834?'},\n","    {'answers': [{'answer_start': 404,\n","       'text': 'director of the Academy of Art'}],\n","     'id': '56d31f8a59d6e41400146264',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': 'What was Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow position?'},\n","    {'answers': [{'answer_start': 749, 'text': 'Maria'}],\n","     'id': '56d31f8a59d6e41400146266',\n","     'is_impossible': False,\n","     'question': 'What was the first name of the girl Chopin proposed to?'}]},\n","  {'context': 'Although it is not known exactly when Chopin first met Liszt after arriving in Paris, on 12 December 1831 he mentioned in a letter to his friend Woyciechowski that \"I have met Rossini, Cherubini, Baillot, etc.—also Kalkbrenner.

The composer frequently took Solange\\'s side in quarrels with her mother; he also faced jealousy from Sand\\'s son Maurice. Chopin was utterly indifferent to Sand\\'s radical political pursuits, while Sand looked on his society friends with disdain.
